Building and installing librstpreload
-------------------------------------
    make && sudo make install
will install `librstpreload.so' into /usr/local/lib/librstpreload.so

Using librstpreload
-------------------
To run a program with librstpreload, use
    LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/librstpreload.so <program>
Assuming the program makes use of localtime(), it should support
Random Standard Time when invoked this way. I reccomend you be careful
about using it indiscriminately: Things such as crontabs or outgoing
mail headers probably shouldn't be using RST.

Making the gnome applet clock RST-compliant
-------------------------------------------
Short version (with Ubuntu ``Hoary Hedgehog'' for me, at least):
# dpkg-divert --rename --add /usr/lib/gnome-panel/clock-applet
# cp clock-applet.sh /usr/lib/gnome-panel/clock-applet
- Restart the clock applet

Long version:
(1) Locate your gnome-panel/clock-applet binary
	It's located in /usr/lib/gnome-panel/clock-applet for me. You
	should be able to find it with a `locate' or by grepping `ps'.
	
(2) Move the binary aside to clock-applet.distrib
	If you're not using debian, move it manually, otherwise do:
	# dpkg --rename --new /path/to/gnome-panel/clock-applet

(3) Move clock-applet.sh to wherever clock-applet was. e.g:
	# mv clock-applet.sh /usr/lib/gnome-panel/clock-applet

(4) Restart the clock applet
	Removing it from the panel and readding it will work, or you can
	kill it and click `restart' when prompted by gnome.
