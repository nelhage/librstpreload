Building and installing librstpreload
-------------------------------------
    make && sudo make install
will install `librstpreload.so' into /usr/local/lib/librstpreload.so

Using librstpreload
-------------------
To run a program with librstpreload, use
    LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/librstpreload.so <program>
Assuming the program makes use of localtime(), it should support
Random Standard Time when invoked this way. I reccomend you be careful
about using it indiscriminately: Things such as crontabs or outgoing
mail headers probably shouldn't be using RST.

Using `mkrst'
-------------------------------------------
`make install' will install a `mkrst' script that can be used to
replace any application with a shell script that invokes the original
executable with LD_PRELOAD set appropriately. It's also Debian-aware,
so that if you're running on a Debian system, it will attempt to
dpkg-divert the original executable, so that dpkg knows it has moved.

To use it:

mkrst --make-rst $EXE

Will move $EXE to $EXE.distrib, and copy a shell script to $EXE that
invokes the original file with LD_PRELOAD set.

mkrst --remove $EXE

Will reverse the effects of mkrst --make-rst

mkrst --run $EXE ARGS

Will execute $EXE with the given arguments with LD_PRELOAD set, but
not change anything on disk.

Example:

sudo mkrst --make-rst /usr/lib/gnome-panel/clock-applet

Will convert the gnome clock applet to RST, assuming it's installed in
the same place my system puts it.
